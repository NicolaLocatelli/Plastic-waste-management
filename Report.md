## 1. Introduction

Background:
Plastic pollution is one of the biggest environmental crises of our time. Every year, over 400 million tonnes of plastic waste are produced worldwide, yet only 9% of it gets recycled (Geyer et al., 2017). Mismanaged plastic waste ends up polluting oceans, harming wildlife, and contributing to climate change (Jambeck et al., 2015).
 
People often assume that a country’s economy growth, automatically corresponds to a positive development in public and private infrastructures, that includes waste management systems too . After all, more money should mean better societal foundation and sisyems, right? In reality, that’s not always the case. Many wealthy nations like the USA (as we will show in our research) still struggle with plastic waste because of weak policies, lack of public awareness, or inefficient systems (World Bank, 2022). Meanwhile, some lower-income countries have made remarkable progress in tackling plastic pollution, not thanks to massive budgets, but through smart policies and community driven efforts. Take Rwanda, for example. Despite limited financial resources, the country has become a leader in waste management by banning plastic bags in 2008, encouraging nationwide community clean-ups (Umuganda), and prioritising environmental education. Thanks to these efforts, Kigali is now one of the cleanest cities in Africa (UNEP, 2021; Government of Rwanda, 2008). 

This study investigates whether GDP alone can be considered as a strong predictor of plastic waste management efficiency or if perhpaps education plays a more significant role; Maybe even analysing the possibility of an indirect correlation between GDP and better practice waste management practices through the influence of better economics contexts on education. By examining global data on economic growth, education levels, and plastic waste trends, we aim to uncover the factors that truly drive sustainable waste management.
 
Objectives
This research focuses on four main objectives:
1. To analyse to which extent a  higher GDP correlates with better plastic waste.
2. To identify regional differences in how countries handle plastic waste.
3. To assess the role of education in shaping waste management policies and behaviours.
4. To determine whether education could be a key mediator between economic progress and sustainability.
 
Research Question:
How do different parts of society affect plastic waste management and where can we see correlations for these tendencies?

 
Sub-questions include:

• How does GDP growth influence plastic waste management policies?

• Which regions show the most effective sustainability strategies, and what can we learn from them?

• Is there a link between higher education levels and better waste management?
           
 
By answering these questions, we aim to contribute to the broader discussion on sustainability and policy-making, offering insights that could shape future environmental strategies.

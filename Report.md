## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Background:

Plastic pollution is one of the biggest environmental crises of our time. Every year, over 400 million tonnes of plastic waste are produced worldwide, yet only 9% of it gets recycled (Geyer et al., 2017). Mismanaged plastic waste ends up polluting oceans, harming wildlife, and contributing to climate change (Jambeck et al., 2015).

In this study, we aim to explore the relationship between societal factors and plastic waste management by addressing the question: “How do different parts of society affect plastic waste management and where can we see correlations for these tendencies?” The motivation behind this research stems from the observation that countries with higher economic outputs often have more resources to invest in environmental infrastructure; however, the effectiveness of these investments may also depend on the population’s education level and awareness regarding sustainability practices.

### 1.2 Objectives

This study investigates whether GDP alone can be considered as a strong predictor of plastic waste management efficiency or if perhaps education plays a more significant role. By examining global data on economic growth, education levels, and plastic waste trends, we aim to uncover the factors that truly drive sustainable waste management.
 
This research focuses on four main objectives:
1. To analyse to which extent a  higher GDP correlates with better plastic waste.
2. To identify regional differences in how countries handle plastic waste.
3. To assess the role of education in shaping waste management policies and behaviours.
4. To determine whether education could be a key mediator between economic progress and sustainability.
 
### 1.3 Research Question:

How do different parts of society affect plastic waste management and where can we see correlations for these tendencies?

 Sub-questions include:

• How does GDP growth influence plastic waste management policies?

• Which regions show the most effective sustainability strategies?

• Is there a link between higher education levels and better waste management?
           
 
By answering these questions, we aim to contribute to the broader discussion on sustainability and policy-making, offering insights that could shape future environmental strategies.

## 2 Theoretical Framework 

In order to shed light on what aspects lead to the most influential and efficient way to approach waste management, we are going to start by defining key concepts and analyze the problem through the analysis of two already existing researches; This foundation is going to allow us to delve more clearly into the chosen aspects of GDP and education.

Our first topic of interest  is related to the correlation of a country’s GDP and how their plastic waste management develops. Related to this concept, I would like to introduce the first relevant citation from the journal, which is titled”Plastics recycling: Challenges and opportunities”.  In this article, plastic waste management refers to the various methods used to reduce, reuse, and recycle plastic waste. Common strategies include mechanical and chemical recycling, incineration, and landfill disposal. Additionally, some countries have introduced strict regulations, such as plastic ban and circular economy policies, to combat the issue [1].
In summary, economic growth, often measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), has been widely studied in relation to environmental degradation. It is interesting to note that the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) suggests that pollution tends to rise with economic growth in the early stages but eventually declines as a country becomes wealthier and invests in sustainable policies [2].

The second question is about how important education is to improve and achieve better waste management. We hypothesized that Educating and Elevating our awareness of plastic pollution could lead to mitigate environmental challenges we are facing. 
Recently, some related research was carried out, “Cordier et al. developed one worldwide socio-economic model to forecast the influence of lack of education plastic pollution by using the data of the World Bank and pointed out that the amount of inadequately managed plastic waste will decrease by 34% compared to the business-as-usual scenario (Cordier et al., 2021) [5] ”. Soares et al. presented a study on the perceived importance of education and knowledge dissemination strategies on the mitigation of plastic pollution (Soares et al., 2021)[6]. These articles is one of the few studies currently focusing on the pathway to minimize plastic pollution through environmental education” On top this statement, Vicente-Molina et al. (2013) concluded that a 1% increase in individual environmental knowledge leads to a 0.4% increase in environmental behavior among university students through model estimation."[7]
This supports the idea that environmental education directly influences pro-environmental behavior, leading to better waste management. Starting from these resources we wanted to analyze from a broader perspective, how much impact both GDP and education have had on the development of better plastic waste management practices. We are going to analyze different geographical regions and countries, and their GDP and education levels from the year  between 2000 to 2020.

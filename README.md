## Introduction
The global surge in plastic production and its consequent waste has led to environmental, economic, and public health challenges. Plastic waste, once seen primarily as a one dimensional and local problem, has now become a complex issue that intertwines environmental management with social, economic, and educational factors. The growing amounts of non degradable plastic in landfills and oceans not only pose severe ecological risks but also affect human populations in profound ways.

People often assume that a country’s economy growth, automatically corresponds to a positive development in public and private infrastructures, that includes waste management systems too. After all, more money should mean better societal foundation and sisyems, right? In reality, that’s not always the case. Many wealthy nations like the USA, still struggle with plastic waste because of weak policies, lack of public awareness, or inefficient systems (World Bank, 2022). Meanwhile, some lower income countries have made remarkable progress in tackling plastic pollution, not thanks to massive budgets, but through smart policies and community driven efforts. Rwanda,for example, despite limited financial resources, has become a leader in waste management by banning plastic bags in 2008 (Government of Rwanda. Ministerial Order N° 003/2008. https://rema.gov.rw), encouraging nationwide community clean ups (Umuganda), and prioritising environmental education. Thanks to these efforts, Kigali is now one of the cleanest cities in Africa (UNEP, 2021; Government of Rwanda, 2008).

In summary, our research aims not only to quantify the relationships between economic and educational factors with waste management but also to provide insights that can guide future policies. This integrated approach is crucial for developing more effective environmental strategies that consider both the economic capabilities and the educational background of a nation’s population.

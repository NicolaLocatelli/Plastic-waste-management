## Introduction
The global surge in plastic production and its consequent waste has led to environmental, economic, and public health challenges. Plastic waste, once seen primarily as a one dimensional and local problem, has now become a complex issue that intertwines environmental management with social, economic, and educational factors. The ever-growing piles of non-degradable plastic in landfills and oceans not only pose severe ecological risks but also affect human populations in subtle yet profound ways.

In this study, we set out to explore the relationship between societal factors and plastic waste management by addressing the question: “How do different parts of society affect plastic waste management and where can we see correlations for these tendencies?” The motivation behind this research stems from the observation that countries with higher economic outputs often have more resources to invest in environmental infrastructure; however, the effectiveness of these investments may also depend on the population’s education level and awareness regarding sustainability practices.

In summary, our research aims not only to quantify the relationships between economic and educational factors with waste management but also to provide insights that can guide future policies. This integrated approach is crucial for developing more effective environmental strategies that consider both the economic capabilities and the educational background of a nation’s populace.
